## Welcome to Vagabond-UML!

This project is a spin-off from [JHipster's UML model](https://jhipster.github.io/jhipster-uml/) which has a main goal to bring support of UML (more precisely, XMI) files (from various editors) to JHipster. Vagabond-UML uses a similar but enhanced model. Scroll down for further information.

We support: Modelio, UML Designer, GenMyModel and Visual Paradigm... and our DSL!
